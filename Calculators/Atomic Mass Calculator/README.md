# Atomic Mass Calculator

## Overview
The Atomic Mass Calculator is a web application designed to compute the atomic mass of a given chemical formula. It uses a JavaScript-based formula parser to interpret the chemical formula input by the user and calculates the total atomic mass based on predefined atomic masses for each element.

## Features
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple form for inputting chemical formulas.
- Comprehensive Element Database: Supports a wide range of elements from the periodic table.
- Real-Time Calculation: Instantly calculates and displays the atomic mass upon form submission.
- Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and a text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).

### Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
    ```sh
    open index.html
    ```
2. Enter a chemical formula  (e.g., H2O, CO2, etc.) in the input field and click the "Calculate" button to see the atomic mass.

## File Structure
- **index.html:** The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- **styles.css:** The CSS file that contains the styles for the web page.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that contains the logic for calculating the atomic mass.
