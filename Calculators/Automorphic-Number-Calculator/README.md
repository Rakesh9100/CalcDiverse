## Description :-

The Automorphic Number Calculator is a user-friendly tool designed to determine if a given number is an automorphic number. An automorphic number is one whose square ends with the number itself. This calculator takes a number input, computes its square, and checks if the square ends with the original number. It then displays the result, indicating whether the number is automorphic or not, along with the relevant calculation details. The calculator also features a reset button to clear the input and results, enabling users to easily check multiple numbers without refreshing the page. Designed with a modern and responsive interface, it ensures a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
