# <p align="center">Ballistic Coefficient Calculator</p>

## Description :-

Ballistic coefficient calculator is a tool used in ballistics to determine the ballistic coefficient of a projectile, such as a bullet. The ballistic coefficient is a measure of a projectile's ability to overcome air resistance during flight. It is an essential factor in understanding how a projectile will behave over long distances, including its trajectory, velocity, and the degree of wind drift.
