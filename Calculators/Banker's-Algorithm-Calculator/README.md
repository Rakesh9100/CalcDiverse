## Description :-

A Banker's Algorithm Calculator is a tool designed to determine the safe sequence for resource allocation in a multi-process system to prevent deadlocks. It assesses the current allocation, maximum demand, and available resources, then simulates resource requests to ensure that all processes can be completed without entering a deadlock state. By checking the feasibility of allocating resources to each process in turn, it helps maintain system stability and efficiency.
