# Baye's Theorem Calculator

## Overview

The Bayesian Theorem Calculator is a web application designed to calculate the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred. Users can input the probability of A (P(A)), the probability of B given A (P(B|A)), and the probability of not A (P(~A)). The calculator then computes and displays the probability of A given B (P(A|B)).

## Tech Stack :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Calculate the Bayesian probability using the provided probabilities.
- User-friendly interface with modern styling and animations.

## How It Works

1. **Input Probabilities:**
   - Enter the probability of A (P(A)).
   - Enter the probability of B given A (P(B|A)).
   - Enter the probability of not A (P(~A)).

2. **Calculate Bayesian Probability:**
   - Click the "Calculate P(A|B)" button to see the result.

3. **Result Display:**
   - The application displays the calculated probability of A given B (P(A|B)).

## Usage

1. Enter the probabilities for P(A), P(B|A), and P(~A).
2. Click the "Calculate P(A|B)" button to see the result.

## Styling and Animations

- The calculator features a clean and modern interface with subtle color grading.
- Buttons have a hover effect with a background color change and a slight scale-up animation.
- Input fields have a focused state with a border color change and a subtle scale-up animation.

Feel free to customize the styling and animations according to your preferences.
