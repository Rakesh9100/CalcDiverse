# <p align="center">Bayes Theorem Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Bayesian Theorem Calculator is a web application designed to calculate the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred. Users can input the probability of A (P(A)), the probability of B given A (P(B|A)), and the probability of not A (P(~A)). The calculator then computes and displays the probability of A given B (P(A|B)).

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works :-

1. **Input Probabilities:**
   - Enter the probability of A (P(A)).
   - Enter the probability of B given A (P(B|A)).
   - Enter the probability of not A (P(~A)).

2. **Calculate Bayesian Probability:**
   - Click the "Calculate P(A|B)" button to see the result.

3. **Result Display:**
   - The application displays the calculated probability of A given B (P(A|B)).
