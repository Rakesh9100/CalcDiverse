# <p align="center">Beta Function Calculator</p>

## Description :-

For solving sums of multivariate calculus, many college students including myself have to go through the hassle of inputting the beta function in expanded form in our scientific calculators. Instead of that if we make a beta function calculator that takes 2 inputs and gives the direct result of Beta(a, b) our task can become simpler! The calculator uses the gamma function (which is an inbuilt function of math.js) to calculate the value of ÃŸ(m, n).
