Beta Function Calculator

- Description:
For solving sums of multivariate calculus, many college students including myself have to go through the hassle of inputting the beta function in expanded form in our scientific calculators. Instead of that if we make a beta function calculator that takes 2 inputs and gives direct result of Beta(a,b) our task can become simpler! The calculator uses gamma function (which is an inbuilt function of math.js) to calculate the value of ÃŸ(m,n). 

- Usage:
1. Open index.html of the project in your browser.
2. Input two numbers (m & n). Beta(m,n) will be calculated by the program.

- Technologies Used
1. HTML: Structure of the web page
2. CSS: Styling of the web page
3. JavaScript: Functionality and interactivity
