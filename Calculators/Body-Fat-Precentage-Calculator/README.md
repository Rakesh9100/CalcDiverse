# <p align="center">Body Fat Precentage Calculator</p>

## Description :-

To calculate body fat percentage, you can use various methods,One of the more accessible methods for many people is using body circumference measurements along with formulas such as the U.S. Navy Method.

Here is how you can calculate your body fat percentage using the U.S. Navy Method:

### For Men:
1. Measure the circumference of your neck (below the larynx, with the tape sloping slightly downward to the front).
2. Measure the circumference of your waist (at the level of your navel).
3. Measure your height.

### For Women:
1. Measure the circumference of your neck (below the larynx, with the tape sloping slightly downward to the front).
2. Measure the circumference of your waist (at the narrowest point).
3. Measure the circumference of your hips (at the widest point).
4. Measure your height.

### Formulas:
- **For Men:**
  $$\text{Body Fat Percentage} = 86.010 \times \log_{10}(\text{waist} - \text{neck}) - 70.041 \times \log_{10}(\text{height}) + 36.76\$$
  
- **For Women:**
  
  $$\text{Body Fat Percentage} = 163.205 \times \log_{10}(\text{waist} + \text{hips} - \text{neck}) - 97.684 \times \log_{10}(\text{height}) - 78.387$$
  

Here, the measurements for waist, neck, hips, and height should be in the same units (either all in inches or all in centimeters).
