# <p align="center">Buoyancy Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Buoyancy Calculator is a simple web-based tool that computes the buoyant force exerted on an object submerged in a fluid. The calculation is based on Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Calculates buoyant force using user-provided values for fluid density, object volume, and gravity.
- Displays the result directly on the web page.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## How to Use :-

1. Enter the density of the fluid in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³).
2. Enter the volume of the object in cubic meters (m³).
3. Enter the acceleration due to gravity in meters per second squared (m/s²), or use the default value of 9.81 m/s².
4. Click the "Calculate Buoyant Force" button to see the result.
