# <p align="center">CGS FPS MKS Calculator</p>

## Description :-

This is a simple unit converter web application that allows users to convert between units in the MKS (Meter-Kilogram-Second), CGS (Centimeter-Gram-Second), and FPS (Foot-Pound-Second) systems. The converter covers various physical quantities, including length, mass, time, area, volume, velocity, acceleration, force, and energy.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Conversion of length, mass, time, area, volume, velocity, acceleration, force, and energy between MKS, CGS, and FPS units.
- Real-time conversion as you type.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Conversion Formulas :-

#### Length
- 1 meter (MKS) = 100 centimeters (CGS) = 3.28084 feet (FPS)

#### Mass
- 1 kilogram (MKS) = 1000 grams (CGS) = 2.20462 pounds (FPS)

#### Time
- 1 second (MKS, CGS, FPS)

#### Area
- 1 square meter (MKS) = 10,000 square centimeters (CGS) = 10.7639 square feet (FPS)

#### Volume
- 1 cubic meter (MKS) = 1,000,000 cubic centimeters (CGS) = 35.3147 cubic feet (FPS)

#### Velocity
- 1 meter/second (MKS) = 100 centimeters/second (CGS) = 3.28084 feet/second (FPS)

#### Acceleration
- 1 meter/second² (MKS) = 100 centimeters/second² (CGS) = 3.28084 feet/second² (FPS)

#### Force
- 1 newton (MKS) = 100,000 dynes (CGS) = 7.233 poundals (FPS)

#### Energy
- 1 joule (MKS) = 10,000,000 ergs (CGS) = 0.73756 foot-pounds (FPS)
