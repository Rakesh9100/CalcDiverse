# <p align="center">Calculates the Wait-time and Turnaround-time for various CPU scheduling algorithm.</p>

## Description :-
This project is a web-based CPU Scheduling Calculator that computes the wait-time and turnaround-time for various CPU scheduling algorithms. Users can input arrival times, burst times, and optionally a time quantum for the Round-Robin (RR) algorithm. The application supports the following scheduling algorithms:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round-Robin (RR)

After entering the required data, the calculator processes the information and displays a detailed output table with the scheduling results, including the start time, completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process.
