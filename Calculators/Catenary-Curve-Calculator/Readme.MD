A simple web application to calculate and visualize the catenary curve based on user inputs. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take user inputs, calculate the curve, and display it on a canvas.
## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Takes user inputs for horizontal distance (span), vertical distance (sag), catenary parameter (a), and number of points.
- Calculates the catenary curve based on the provided inputs.
- Displays the catenary curve on a canvas element.


## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the required inputs for the horizontal distance (span), vertical distance (sag), catenary parameter (a) (optional), and number of points.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. The catenary curve will be displayed on the canvas.
