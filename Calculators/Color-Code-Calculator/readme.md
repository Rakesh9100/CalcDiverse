- Select your desired format, to which you want it to be converted.
- Press the `Convert` button.
- Click the `Copy` button to copy the converted color code.

## Implementation

- All color converter logic are written from scratch, no apis / libraries used.
- One can find the logic for the conversions and for pattern checking for each color format in the `converter.js` file.

## Techstack Used
- HTML for rendering the front-end.
- CSS for Styling.
- Vanilla JavaScript (JS) for rendering the logic.
    - `script.js` manages the conversion from and to mappings, and also the DOM management
    - `converter.js` manages the logic behind each individual conversions between color formats, and also verifies the correct color code format.
