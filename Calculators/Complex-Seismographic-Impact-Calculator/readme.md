The **Seismographic Impact Calculator** is a web application designed to estimate the impact of an earthquake based on its magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, population density, and building types. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Input fields for seismic magnitude, epicenter distance, and population density
- Optional selection for building types
- Calculation of Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI), estimated damage levels, and affected population
- Real-time display of results

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web page
- **CSS**: For styling the application
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the core functionality
