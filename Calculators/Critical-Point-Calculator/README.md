## Description :-

Creating a critical point calculator for ideal gases involves calculating the critical temperature, critical pressure, and critical volume based on the Van der Waals equation of state.

The critical point of an ideal gas is a set of specific thermodynamic conditions where the distinction between the gas and liquid phases disappears. At this point:

Critical Temperature (Tc): This is the highest temperature at which the gas can be liquefied by applying pressure. Above this temperature, no amount of pressure can cause condensation into a liquid phase.

Critical Pressure (Pc): The critical pressure is the pressure required to liquefy the gas at its critical temperature. Below this pressure, the gas cannot be liquefied by any means.

Critical Volume (Vc): This is the molar volume of the gas at the critical point, where the densities of the gas and liquid phases become equal.
