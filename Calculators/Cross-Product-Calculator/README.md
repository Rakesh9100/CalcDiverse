## Description :-

Welcome to the Cross Product Calculator! This simple web application allows you to calculate the cross-product of two 3D vectors and find the angle between them.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How it Works :-

The cross-product of two vectors results in a new vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors. Its direction is determined by the right-hand rule.

The formula to calculate the cross product of two vectors ùêØ and ùê∞ is:

A √ó B = |A| |B| sin Œ∏ n

## Usage :-

To use the calculator, simply input the components of the two vectors (i, j, k) into the provided input fields and click the "Calculate" button. The result, including the cross-product and the angle between the vectors, will be displayed below.
