# Cross Product Calculator

Welcome to the Cross Product Calculator! This simple web application allows you to calculate the cross product of two 3D vectors and find the angle between them.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply input the components of the two vectors (i, j, k) into the provided input fields and click the "Calculate" button. The result, including the cross product and the angle between the vectors, will be displayed below.

## How it Works

The cross product of two vectors results in a new vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors. Its direction is determined by the right-hand rule.

The formula to calculate the cross product of two vectors ùêØ and ùê∞ is:

A √ó B = |A| |B| sin Œ∏ n
