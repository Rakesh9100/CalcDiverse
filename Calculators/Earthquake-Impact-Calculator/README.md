# <p align="center">Earthquake Impact Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Earthquake Impact Calculator is a web application that helps you estimate the potential impact of an earthquake in terms of ground shaking intensity, damage, and affected population based on earthquake magnitude and distance from the epicenter.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Enter the earthquake magnitude (Richter scale).
- Enter the distance from the epicenter in km.
- Enter the local population density.
- (Optional) Select the types of buildings in the area.
- Perform the calculation and display the results including Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI), estimated damage levels, and estimated affected population.

## Example :-

To estimate the impact of a 7.0 magnitude earthquake:
1. Enter "7.0" for the earthquake magnitude.
2. Enter the distance from the epicenter, for example, 50 km.
3. Enter the local population density, for example, 1000 people per square km.
4. (Optional) Select the building types, for example, "Reinforced Concrete" (commonly found in urban areas).
5. Click "Calculate" to get the results including PGA, MMI, estimated damage levels, and estimated affected population.
