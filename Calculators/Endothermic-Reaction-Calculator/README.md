## Features :-

This calculator computes the energy absorbed in an endothermic reaction by using the formula Q=m⋅c⋅ΔT, where ΔT is the temperature change, 𝑚 is the mass, and 𝑐 is the specific heat capacity. Input the initial and final temperatures, mass, and specific heat capacity, and the calculator will display the energy absorbed.
