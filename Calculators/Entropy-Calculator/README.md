## Ultimate Entropy Calculator

This project is a web-based Entropy Calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore the concept of entropy, allowing users to calculate the entropy of a set of probabilities.

### Features:

- **Dynamic Input Fields:**  The calculator dynamically generates input fields for probabilities based on the number specified by the user.
- **Entropy Calculation:**  It accurately calculates the Shannon entropy of the provided probability distribution.
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  A visually appealing and interactive interface with clear instructions and error handling.
- **Engaging Animation:**  A subtle, animated background element adds visual interest to the user experience.
- **Responsive Design:**  The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring readability on various devices.
- **Informative Explanation:**  Provides a detailed explanation of entropy and its relevance in information theory and probability.

### How to Use:

1. **Specify Number of Probabilities:** Enter the desired number of probabilities in the "Number of Probabilities" input field.
2. **Enter Probabilities:** Input the probability values for each event, making sure they are between 0 and 1.
3. **Calculate Entropy:** Click the "Calculate Entropy" button to compute the entropy of the distribution.
4. **View Results:**  The calculated entropy will be displayed in bits.
5. **Explore Entropy:** Adjust the number of probabilities and their values to observe how the entropy changes.
