# <p align="center">Exponential Decay Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Exponential Decay Calculator is a web-based tool designed to compute the remaining amount of a substance after a given period, using the exponential decay formula. This calculator helps users to understand and calculate the decay process efficiently by inputting the initial amount, decay constant, and time.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- **Input Fields**: Enter the initial amount, decay constant, and time to compute the remaining amount.
- **Instant Feedback**: Provides immediate results based on the inputs.
