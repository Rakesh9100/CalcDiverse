# <p align="center">Fascinating Number Calculator</p>

## Description :-

This is a simple web application that allows users to check if a given number is a fascinating number or not. 
A fascinating number is a positive number that contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once and does not contain any 0's
after concatenating the number(x) with the numbers 2 * x and 3 * x. 

For example, the number 192 is fascinating because (192 * 2 = 384 and 192 * 3 = 576), and after concatenating it becomes (192384576) which contains all the digits from 1 to 9.
