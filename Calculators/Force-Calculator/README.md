# <p align="center">Force Calculator</p>

## Description :-

A simple web application to calculate Newton's force using the formula F = ma (Force = Mass x Acceleration). This project allows users to input the mass and acceleration values to calculate the force.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Input fields for mass and acceleration
- Calculate button to compute the force
- Display of the calculated force
- Responsive design
- Gradient background 

## Usage :-

1. Open the application.
2. Enter the mass in kilograms (kg) in the "Mass" input field.
3. Enter the acceleration in meters per second squared (m/sÂ²) in the "Acceleration" input field.
4. Click the "Calculate Force" button to compute the force.
5. The calculated force will be displayed below the button.
