## Description :-

A Frequency Calculator is designed to compute the frequency of a periodic event or waveform. Frequency is a fundamental concept in physics, particularly in the study of waves, oscillations, and alternating current (AC) circuits. It refers to the number of cycles or oscillations that occur in a unit of time, typically measured in hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz equals one cycle per second.
