## Description :-

The Happy Number Calculator is a web application designed to check whether a given number is a happy number or not. It also provides the ability to find happy numbers within a specified range.

## What is a Happy Number?

A happy number is a positive integer that, when replaced by the sum of the square of its digits repeatedly, eventually leads to the number 1. If the process results in an endless cycle containing the number 4, then the number is considered an unhappy number.

For example, the number 19 is a happy number:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
