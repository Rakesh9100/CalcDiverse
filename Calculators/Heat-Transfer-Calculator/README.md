# <p align="center">Heat Transfer Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Heat Transfer Calculator is designed to calculate the amount of heat transferred between one region of temperature T1 and another region of temperature T2, which are L distance apart. The cross sectional area through which heat transfer occurs is A and the thermal conductivity of the material is K.
Working formula:- H = (K* A *(T<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>2</sub>)*t)/L

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Takes user input of thermal conductivity,length,cross-sectional area, temperatures of the two regions and time span of heat transfer in SI units.
- Displays the calculated heat transferred (in joules).
