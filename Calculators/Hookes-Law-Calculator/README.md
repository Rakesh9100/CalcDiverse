# <p align="center">Hookes Law Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Hooke's Law Calculator (spring force calculator) helps to determine the force in any spring that is stretched or compressed. One can also use it as a spring constant calculator if one knows the force. The calculator provides three fields: spring displacement (Δx), spring constant (k), and force (F). By entering any two inputs, the third field is calculated.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Calculate force (F) given spring displacement (Δx) and spring constant (k).
- Calculate spring constant (k) given force (F) and spring displacement (Δx).
- Calculate spring displacement (Δx) given force (F) and spring constant (k).
- Displays a message prompting the user to enter only two values if all three fields are filled.
