# Ideal Gas Calculator

The Ideal Gas Calculator is a web application that helps you calculate one of the variables (Pressure, Volume, Moles, or Temperature) of an ideal gas using the Ideal Gas Law equation: PV = nRT.

## Tech Stacks

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for displaying input fields dynamically and performing the calculations.

## Features

- Select the variable you want to find (Pressure, Volume, Moles, or Temperature).
- Enter the known values for the other variables.
- Supports multiple units for each variable:
  - Pressure: atm, Pa, kPa, mmHg
  - Volume: liters, ml, m³
  - Temperature: K, °C, °F
- Perform the calculation and display the result.

## Example

To find the pressure (P) of a gas:
1. Select "Pressure (P)" from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter the values for Volume (V), Moles (n), and Temperature (T) in their respective units.
3. Click "Calculate" to get the pressure in the chosen unit.
