# <p align="center">Ideal Gas Law Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Ideal Gas Calculator is a web application that helps you calculate one of the variables (Pressure, Volume, Moles, or Temperature) of an ideal gas using the Ideal Gas Law equation: PV = nRT.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Select the variable you want to find (Pressure, Volume, Moles, or Temperature).
- Enter the known values for the other variables.
- Supports multiple units for each variable:
  - Pressure: atm, Pa, kPa, mmHg
  - Volume: liters, ml, m³
  - Temperature: K, °C, °F
- Perform the calculation and display the result.

## Example :-

To find the pressure (P) of a gas:
1. Select "Pressure (P)" from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter the values for Volume (V), Moles (n), and Temperature (T) in their respective units.
3. Click "Calculate" to get the pressure in the chosen unit.
