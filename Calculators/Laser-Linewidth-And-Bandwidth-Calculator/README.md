# <p align="center">Laser Linewidth And Bandwidth Calculator</p>

## Description :-

A simple web-based calculator to compute the **linewidth** and **bandwidth** of a laser. These parameters are critical in determining the performance and applications of a laser system, such as in fiber optics.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Accepts **Frequency (Hz)** and **Quality Factor (Q)** as inputs.
- Calculates:
  - **Linewidth** = Frequency / Quality Factor
  - **Bandwidth** = GainBandwidth Ã— (1 - DampingFactor)
- Provides real-time results with an interactive UI.
