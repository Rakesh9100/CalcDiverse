# <p align="center">Least Squares Regression Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Least Squares Regression Calculator is designed to fit data to a linear model using the least squares method. It calculates the best-fit line for a given set of data points and provides important regression statistics, such as the slope, intercept, R-squared value, and standard error. This tool is useful for anyone needing to analyze the relationship between two variables and make predictions based on the linear trend.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chart.js

## Features :-

- **Data Input**: Allows users to input data points manually.
- **Best-Fit Line Calculation**: Computes the slope and intercept of the best-fit line using the least squares method.
- **Regression Statistics**: Provides additional statistics including:
  - R-squared value: Measures the goodness of fit.
  - Standard error: Estimates the accuracy of the coefficients.
- **Data Visualization**: Plots the data points along with the best-fit line on a graph for visual analysis.
- **Dark Mode**: Implements a dark theme for the entire interface to reduce eye strain and improve aesthetics.

## How to Use :-

1. **Input Data**: Enter your data points in the format `x1,y1;x2,y2;...` into the input box.
2. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to compute the regression line and display the results.
3. **View Results**: The calculated regression equation, R-squared value, and standard error will be displayed. The data points and regression line will be plotted on the chart.
