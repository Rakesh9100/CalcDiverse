## Description :-

The Love Calculator is a simple web application designed for entertainment purposes, providing users with a playful percentage score of love compatibility based on inputted names. It is important to note that the Love Calculator is purely for fun and does not have any scientific basis.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works :-

The Love Calculator uses a basic algorithm to generate a love percentage. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Input Names:**
   - Users enter two names into the input fields.

2. **Combination:**
   - The names are concatenated into a single string.

3. **Hash Calculation:**
   - A hash value is calculated by summing the ASCII values of each character in the combined string.

4. **Love Percentage:**
   - The hash value is then used to determine a love percentage by taking the modulus 101 (to keep it within the 0-100 range).
