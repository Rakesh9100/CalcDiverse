## How It Works

The Love Calculator uses a basic algorithm to generate a love percentage. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Input Names:**
   - Users enter two names into the input fields.

2. **Combination:**
   - The names are concatenated into a single string.

3. **Hash Calculation:**
   - A hash value is calculated by summing the ASCII values of each character in the combined string.

4. **Love Percentage:**
   - The hash value is then used to determine a love percentage by taking the modulus 101 (to keep it within the 0-100 range).

## Usage

1. Enter the names of two individuals.
2. Click the "Calculate Love" button to see the generated love percentage.

## Disclaimer

The Love Calculator is created for entertainment purposes only. The algorithm used for calculating the love percentage is arbitrary and does not have any scientific or real-world basis. Results should not be taken seriously, and users are encouraged to enjoy the application in a lighthearted manner.
