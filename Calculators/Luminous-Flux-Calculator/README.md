# <p align="center">Luminous Flux Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Luminous Flux Calculator helps you determine the luminous flux, measured in lumens (lm), based on the luminous intensity and angle. Simply input the luminous intensity in candelas (cd) and the angle in degrees, and the calculator will compute the resulting luminous flux, providing a quick and easy way to understand the light output of a source.

## How It Works :-

The Luminous Flux Calculator uses a simple formula to compute the luminous flux. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Input Values:**
Users enter the luminous intensity in candelas (cd) and the angle in degrees into the input fields.

2. **Angle Conversion:**
The angle is converted from degrees to radians for use in the calculation.

3. **Flux Calculation:**
The luminous flux is calculated using the formula: Œ¶=I‚ãÖ2œÄ(1‚àícos(2/Œ∏)), where ùêº is the luminous intensity and Œ∏ is the angle in radians.

4. **Result Display:**
The calculated luminous flux in lumens (lm) is displayed to the user.
