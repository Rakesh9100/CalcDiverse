## How It Works :-

The Advanced Macros Calculator uses a series of steps to compute and display the macronutrient needs. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **Input Values:**
   Users enter their age, weight, height, gender, and activity level into the input fields.

2. **BMR Calculation:**
   The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation, which differs for males and females.

3. **TDEE Calculation:**
   The Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is computed by multiplying the BMR by the activity level factor.

4. **Macros Distribution:**
   - **Protein:** Calculated as 2 grams per kilogram of body weight.
   - **Fats:** Set to 25% of the total calorie intake, converted to grams.
   - **Carbohydrates:** The remaining calories are allocated to carbohydrates.

5. **Result Display:**
   The calculated values for calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fats are displayed to the user.
