# <p align="center">Mass Spring Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Mass Spring Calculator is a web application that calculates various properties of a mass-spring system. Given the mass of the object (m), the spring constant (k), and the amplitude (A), the calculator computes the following properties:

- Period of Oscillation (T)
- Frequency of Oscillation (f)
- Angular Frequency (Ï‰)
- Maximum Speed (v_max)
- Maximum Acceleration (a_max)
- Kinetic Energy at Maximum Speed (KE)
- Potential Energy at Maximum Displacement (PE)

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Calculate the period, frequency, angular frequency, maximum speed, maximum acceleration, kinetic energy, and potential energy of a mass-spring system.
- User-friendly interface with input fields for mass, spring constant, and amplitude.
- Responsive design with a background image and enhanced styling.
- Clear and detailed display of calculated results.
