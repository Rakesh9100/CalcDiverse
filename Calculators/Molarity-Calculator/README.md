# <p align="center">Molarity Calculator</p>

## Description :-

This molarity calculator computes the mass of a solute required to achieve a desired solution volume and concentration. The interface is responsive, and colorful, and includes animations to enhance the user experience.

## Features :-

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on various devices.
- **Background Animation:** The background color transitions smoothly for a pleasant visual effect.
- **Container Animation:** The main container fades in smoothly upon loading.

- **Focus Effects:** Inputs change border color on focus for improved accessibility.
- **Result Animation:** The result fades in when calculated, making it more noticeable.

## Usage :-

1. **Formula Weight (g/mol):** Enter the formula weight of the solute in grams per mole.
2. **Desired Final Volume:** Enter the desired final volume of the solution and select the unit (Liters, Milliliters, or Microliters).
3. **Desired Concentration:** Enter the desired concentration and select the unit (Molar, Millimolar, or Micromolar).
4. **Calculate Mass:** Click the "Calculate Mass" button to compute the required mass of the solute. The result will be displayed in grams.

## Example :-

Here is an example of how to use the calculator:
1. Enter `120` for the formula weight (g/mol).
2. Enter `100` for the desired final volume and select `milliliters (mL)`.
3. Enter `12` for the desired concentration and select `molar (M)`.
4. Click "Calculate Mass" to get the result: `144` grams.
