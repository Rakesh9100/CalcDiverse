## What is a Neon Number?

A neon number is a number where the sum of its digits, when squared, equals the original number. Mathematically, for a given number 'n', if the sum of the digits of n^2 is equal to n, then it is a neon number.

For example, 9 is a neon number because 9^2 = 81, and the sum of the digits of 81 is 8 + 1 = 9.
