Ohm's Law Calculator

Description
An interactive web-based calculator for Ohm's Law, built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This calculator allows users to compute the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. It also allows user to find the power in watts. 

* Features
- Calculate Voltage (V)
- Calculate Current (I)
- Calculate Resistance (R)
- Calculate Power(P)

* Usage:
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Enter any two of the following values:
    - Voltage (V)
    - Current (I)
    - Resistance (R)
The calculator will compute the third value and power automatically.

* Technologies Used
1. HTML: Structure of the web page
2. CSS: Styling of the web page
3. JavaScript: Functionality and interactivity
