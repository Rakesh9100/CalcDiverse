## Description :-

An interactive web-based calculator for Ohm's Law that allows users to compute the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. It also allows users to find the power in watts.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Calculate Voltage (V)
- Calculate Current (I)
- Calculate Resistance (R)
- Calculate Power(P)

## Usage :-

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Enter any two of the following values:
    - Voltage (V)
    - Current (I)
    - Resistance (R)
The calculator will compute the third value and power automatically.
