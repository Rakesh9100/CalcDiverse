# Palindrome Checker
This is a simple website that checks whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome.

## Features
>Checks for single words and phrases (including spaces and punctuation).
Displays a clear message indicating if the input is a palindrome or not.
Handles case-insensitivity (e.g., "Racecar" and "RACECAR" are both considered palindromes).

## Install dependencies:

The website uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No additional dependencies are required.

Open the index.html file in your web browser to test the application.

## How it Works
The website utilizes JavaScript to analyze the input text. It iterates through the characters, comparing the first with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on. If all characters match in reverse order, the input is considered a palindrome.
