## Description :-

The Pendulum Calculator is a web application that calculates various properties of a pendulum system based on the length of the pendulum (l), the gravitational acceleration (g), the amplitude (A), and the mass of the bob (m). The calculator computes the following properties:

- Period of the Pendulum (T)
- Frequency of the Pendulum (f)
- Angular Frequency (Ï‰)
- Maximum Speed
- Maximum Acceleration
- Kinetic Energy at the Lowest Point
- Potential Energy at the Highest Point

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Calculate the period, frequency, angular frequency, maximum speed, maximum acceleration, kinetic energy, and potential energy of a pendulum system.
- User-friendly interface with input fields for length, gravitational acceleration, amplitude, and mass.
- Responsive design with a background image and enhanced styling.
- Clear and detailed display of calculated results.
