## Description :-

This calculator collects the length of the pendulum(l), gravitational acceleration(g), amplitude (A - optional), and mass of the bob (m - optional) provide below results:

- Period (T) and Frequency (f) are always calculated based on l and g.

- Maximum Speed (v_max), Maximum Acceleration (a_max), Kinetic Energy (KE), and Potential Energy (PE) are calculated only if A and m are provided.
