# Perfect Number Checker

This is a simple web application that allows users to check if a given number is a perfect number. 
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. In other words, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all its positive divisors, including 1 but excluding itself.

For example, the number 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 
1+2+3=6, which is equal to the number itself.
