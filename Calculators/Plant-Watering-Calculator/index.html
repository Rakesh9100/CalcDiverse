        <h2>Plant Types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Succulents:</strong> These are plants with thick, fleshy parts that are adapted to store water. Examples include cacti and aloe.</li>
            <li><strong>Ferns:</strong> These are non-flowering plants that reproduce via spores. They typically prefer shady, moist environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Flowering Plants:</strong> These are plants that produce flowers as part of their reproductive process. Examples include roses and daisies.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> These are plants where the leaves, roots, stems, flowers, or seeds are edible. Examples include tomatoes and lettuce.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Soil Types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sandy:</strong> This type of soil has large particles and doesn't hold onto water well. It's good for plants that need well-draining soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Loamy:</strong> This type of soil is a balanced mix of sand, silt, and clay. It's ideal for most plants because it holds moisture but also drains well.</li>
            <li><strong>Clay:</strong> This type of soil has very small particles and holds onto water for a long time. It's good for plants that need a lot of water, but it can be problematic if it gets waterlogged.</li>
        </ul>
