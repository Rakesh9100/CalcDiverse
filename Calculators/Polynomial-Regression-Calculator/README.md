# <p align="center">Polynomial Regression Calculator</p>

## Description

This calculator allows users to input a set of data points and compute the best-fit polynomial curve of a specified degree using polynomial regression. It displays the polynomial equation, regression coefficients, and a plot of the data points along with the fitted curve.

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript

## Features

- Users can input data points in the form of (x, y) pairs.
- Users can specify the degree of the polynomial for regression.
- The calculator computes the polynomial regression using the least squares method.
- It visually plots the data points and the polynomial regression curve on a canvas for easier data analysis and interpretation.
- Displays the polynomial equation with all coefficients.
