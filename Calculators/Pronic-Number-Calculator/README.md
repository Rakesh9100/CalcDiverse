## What is a Pronic Number?

A pronic number, also known as an oblong or heteromecic number, is a product of two consecutive integers, that is, the product of n and (n + 1) for some integer n. Mathematically, a pronic number can be expressed as:

\[ P_n = n \times (n + 1) \]

For example, 6 is a pronic number because it can be expressed as \( 2 \times (2 + 1) \).
