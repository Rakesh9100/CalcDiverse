# Remainder Calculator

## Description
The Remainder Calculator is a new addition to the project, allowing users to input a dividend and divisor, and it returns both the remainder and quotient. This calculator is designed to handle various scenarios, including NaN conditions, division by zero (returns infinity), and division by zero resulting in a quotient of zero. 

## Features
- Takes user input of dividend and divisor.
- Calculates and displays the remainder and quotient.
- Handles NaN conditions by alerting the user.
- Handles division by zero, returning infinity.
- Handles division by zero resulting in a quotient of zero.

## Testing
The Remainder Calculator has been thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and accuracy. Here are the testing scenarios:

- Various calculations have been performed to validate the correctness of the results.
- NaN conditions have been tested to ensure proper alerting to the user.
- Division by zero has been tested, and the calculator returns infinity.
- Division by zero resulting in a quotient of zero has also been tested and handled appropriately.

## Usage
To use the Remainder Calculator:
1. Input the dividend and divisor.
2. Click on the calculate button.
3. The remainder and quotient will be displayed.
