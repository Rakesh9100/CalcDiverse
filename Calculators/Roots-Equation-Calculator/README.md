## Description :-

This is a simple web application that allows users to generate polynomial equations based on given roots.

Users can input the number of roots, provide the roots themselves, and the application will generate the corresponding polynomial equation. For example, if the user inputs two roots, 2 and 2, the application will generate the equation (x-2)(x-2)=x^2-4x+4=0

This tool is useful for anyone needing to quickly derive polynomial equations from specified roots.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Users can input the number of roots.
