# <p align="center">Roots Equation Calculator</p>

## Description :-

This is a simple web application that allows users to generate polynomial equations based on given roots.

Users can input the number of roots, and provide the roots themselves, and the application will generate the corresponding polynomial equation. For example, if the user inputs two roots, 2 and 2, the application will generate the equation (x-2)(x-2)=x^2-4x+4=0

This tool is useful for anyone needing to quickly derive polynomial equations from specified roots.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Users can input the number of roots.
- Upon clicking the "Generate Inputs" button, input fields for each root are generated.
- Users can then input the values of the roots.
- Upon clicking the "Generate Equation" button, the application generates the corresponding polynomial equation.
- The generated polynomial equation is displayed below the input fields.
- This tool is useful for quickly deriving polynomial equations from specified roots.
