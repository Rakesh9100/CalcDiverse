# <p align="center">SVD Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The SVD Calculator simplifies the process of performing Singular Value Decomposition, which is widely used in numerical analysis, machine learning, and data science. Given a square matrix, the tool decomposes it into:

- 𝑈 : An orthogonal matrix containing the left singular vectors.
- 𝑆 : A diagonal matrix containing the singular values.
- 𝑉 : An orthogonal matrix containing the right singular vectors.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML 
- CSS 
- JavaScript

## Features :-

- Intuitive input fields with placeholders and labels for better usability.
- Styled using CSS with gradient backgrounds, hover effects, and smooth transitions.
- Provides error messages when invalid inputs are detected.
- Uses the powerful numeric.js library for fast and accurate matrix computations.
