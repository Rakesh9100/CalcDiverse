# <p align="center">Shortest Path Calculator</p>

## Description :-

It is a simple calculator which calculates the shortest path between two points. It uses the `Dijkstra's Algorithm` to calculate the shortest path. You can add the nodes and edges between them and then calculate the shortest path between them. You can make your own graph and calculate the shortest path between any two nodes.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to use :-

- First, you have to add the nodes by clicking on the `Add Node` button. (If node is not visible to you, then scroll in between the output area and set up your node.)
- Then you have to add the edges between the nodes by clicking on the `Add Edge` button.
- After adding the nodes and edges, you have to select the source and destination nodes.
- Then click on the `Calculate` button to calculate the shortest path between the source and destination nodes.
