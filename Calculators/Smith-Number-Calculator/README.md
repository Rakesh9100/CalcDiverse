## Description :-

The Smith Number Calculator is a web application designed to determine whether a given number is a Smith number or not. A Smith number is a composite number whose sum of digits is equal to the sum of the digits of its prime factors, excluding the digit 1. In other words, a Smith number can be expressed as the product of its prime factors, and when you add up the digits of both the original number and its prime factors, the sums are the same.
