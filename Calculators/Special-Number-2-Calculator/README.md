## Description :-

This Calculator predicts whether the number that is being provided as input by the user is a Special Number or not.
A "special number" typically refers to a number with unique properties, but the definition can vary. For this example, let's consider a special number to be one whose sum of the factorial of digits equals the number itself.
For example, 145 is a special number because 1! + 4! + 5! = 145
