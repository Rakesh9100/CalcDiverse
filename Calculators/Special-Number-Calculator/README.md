# <p align="center">Special Number Calculator</p>

## Description :-

Calculator which checks if it is a special number or not.

A Special Number is calculated as follows:

1. Start with any integer value greater than 0.
2. Calculate the sum of the digits of the number.
3. Reverse the sum obtained in step 1.
4. Multiply the sum and its reversal.
5. If the product equals the original number, it is a special number.

For example, 1729 is a special number since, when its digits are added together, produces a sum that, when multiplied by its reversal, yields the original number:<br>

1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19<br>
19 Ã— 91 = 1729
