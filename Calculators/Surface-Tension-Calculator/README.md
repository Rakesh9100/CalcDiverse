## Description :-

Surface Tension Calculator calculates surface tension for different shapes like flat object, doplets, hollow bubbles.

To calculate surface tension:

* Select the shape from the list, say Droplet.
* Enter the diameter of the droplet.
* Insert the pressure intensity inside the droplet.
* The surface tension calculator will return the force and the surface tension for the droplet.
