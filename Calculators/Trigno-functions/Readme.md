Created Scientific Calculator with Trigonometric Functions and Inverse Trigonometric Functions with Best UI and Functionality

Fixes Issueüõ†Ô∏è
<!-- Example: Closes #1500  -->
Closes #1500 
[Feature] Add Scientific Calculator #1500

Descriptionüë®‚Äçüíª
In this update, I've developed a fully functional scientific calculator that supports:

Trigonometric functions such as sin, cos, tan
Inverse trigonometric functions like arcsin, arccos, arctan
Logarithmic functions (log, log10)
Square roots, cube roots, and other mathematical operations
A sleek dark-themed UI with enhanced usability and accessibility
This version also includes:

Error handling for invalid input (e.g., "asin(0.5)" or "log(10)").
Support for edge cases (e.g., logarithms with values <= 0).
A clear, user-friendly layout with all buttons styled appropriately, enhancing the overall experience.
Includes a "Clear" button for resetting the input, a "Delete" button for removing the last character, and an "Equals" button in an orange color to indicate its importance.
