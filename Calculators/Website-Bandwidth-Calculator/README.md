# Website Bandwidth Estimator

This is a simple website calculator that estimates the bandwidth needs of a website based on three factors:

### Page Views: The total number of times your website is loaded in a given period.
### Average Page Size: The average size of a webpage on your website in megabytes (MB).
### Page Views Per Visitor: The average number of pages a visitor views on your website during a single visit (also known as redundancy factor).

## How to Use:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Enter the following values:
1) Page Views: The estimated number of page views your website expects in a given period.
2) Average Page Size: The average size of a webpage on your website in MB. You can use tools like https://gtmetrix.com/ or https://pagespeed.web.dev/ to measure your website's page size.
3) Page Views Per Visitor: The average number of pages a visitor views on your website during a single visit. This value is typically between 1 and 3.
4) Click the "Calculate" button.
5) The estimated website bandwidth will be displayed in the result section.

### Note:

> This is a basic estimation tool and may not reflect the exact bandwidth requirements of your website.
Other factors, such as the use of multimedia content and traffic patterns, can also affect bandwidth usage.
