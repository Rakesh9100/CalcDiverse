# <p align="center">Website Bandwidth Estimator</p>

This is a simple website calculator that estimates the bandwidth needs of a website based on three factors:

#### Page Views: The total number of times your website is loaded in a given period.
#### Average Page Size: The average size of a webpage on your website in megabytes (MB).
#### Page Views Per Visitor: The average number of pages a visitor views on your website during a single visit (also known as redundancy factor).

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Note:

> This is a basic estimation tool and may not reflect the exact bandwidth requirements of your website.
Other factors, such as the use of multimedia content and traffic patterns, can also affect bandwidth usage.
