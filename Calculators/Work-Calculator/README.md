# <p align="center">Work Calculator</p>

## Description :-

The Work Calculator calculates the work W.
If the force is being exerted at an angle θ to the displacement, the work done is W = fd cos θ.
The formula `W = F.d.cosθ` is used in physics to calculate the work done by a force on an object, where `W` is work, `F` is the force's magnitude, `d` is the displacement's magnitude, and `θ` is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.

## Tech Stacks :-

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features :-

The Work Calculator calculates the work W which is equal to the force f times the distance d, or W = fd.
